## Applatix kube-ops-view application

#### Synopsis

App version of [kube-ops-view](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-ops-view). As per it's description, kube-ops-view's goal is to provide a common operational picture for one or more Kubernetes clusters.

#### Motivation

Kube-ops-view by itself is a nifty tool that shows the current state of a Kubernetes cluster. However, installing and using it has several manual steps and limitations. This Applatix App for kube-ops-view eliminates these manual steps. It does the installation, configuration and deployment of kube-ops-view at the click of a button.

#### Configuration

The only configuration required from the user is the domain name for the display url.
